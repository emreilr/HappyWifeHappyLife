## About The Project

This repository contains Python scripts that leverage procedural drawing techniques to create artistic illustrations. It features:
* **Animated Drawing:** Watch the artwork being drawn stroke by stroke.
* **Procedural Generation:** Uses randomization (`random` module) to ensure no two drawings are exactly the same.
* **Geometry & Math:** Utilizes trigonometric functions (`math.sin`, `math.cos`) for precise petal and leaf placement.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

To run this project, you need **Python 3** installed on your system.

### Important: Tkinter Installation
This project requires the **Tkinter** GUI toolkit to render the graphics. While Tkinter is standard in many Python distributions, **it is not always installed by default** (especially on Linux or minimal macOS installations).

Please ensure Tkinter is installed before running the scripts:

#### 🐧 For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

#### For macOS
If you encounter an error related to _tkinter, you may need to install it via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install python-tk
```

#### For Windows
Ensure that the "tcl/tk and IDLE" option was checked during your Python installation setup. If not, modify your Python installation via the "Add or Remove Programs" menu.

#### Installation & Usage
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/emreilr/HappyWifeHappyLife.git](https://github.com/emreilr/HappyWifeHappyLife.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd HappyWifeHappyLife
    ```

3.  **Run the script:** **(FileName.py)**
    ```bash
    python3 DrawingHeart.py
    ```
